# ArduinoDistanceGame
A hot and cold distance finding game for my physical computing course.

# Main Program
Open project1.ino in the ardiuno IDE and plug your arduino into your computer, compile and upload the sketch. 
You can view the serial output from the arduino by clicking on the little hourglass in the top right of the IDE. 
Make sure that the serial port is listening at a Baud rate of 9600.
Have Fun!

# Schematics
Open the project1.fzz file in Fritzing to view the project schematics and wire diagrams.
